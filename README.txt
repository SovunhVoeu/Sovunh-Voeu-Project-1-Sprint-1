Before you run this program paste your API key into the YOUR_API_KEY.txt
(WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LINE IN THE .TXT FOR THE API. DO NOT HAVE AN EXTRA LINE OR IT WILL NOT RUN)
The program will read your .txt file and allow you to use the AI/LLM.
In order to get started you must input the question into the prompt code line since the descriptions are hard coded.
Example: Hello, can you create a resume for me using these descriptions?

I chose this AI/LLM because it looked the simplest to me. I had no errors adding the
codes to my program and developing my program further.

Libraries used: os, Path, google.generativeai

The changes that I have made to settle over the prompt given over the others is I gave a more indepth job description
so that the format would look more professional.

The job description I had chose to go with was: Application Developer from the JSON
