The program will read your .txt file and allow you to use the AI/LLM.
In order to get started you must input the question into the prompt code line.

I chose this AI/LLM because it looked the simplest to me. I had no errors adding the
codes to my program and developing my program further.

The job description I had chose to go with was:
"I am looking for a job that capitalizes on programming and making business deals with big industries.
I want to work in an industry instead of a small company.
Some of the companies I was looking at was Google, Microsoft, or Meta.
I am also capable of working at a company that uses databases as well.
I have no worries about the location and prefer to work a travel job."

The personal description I gave was:
"I am an unemployed university student who is 22 years old.
I am going to receive my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
I have an extensive background in AI and programming.
I have a certificate in advanced Java programming and I know various languages such as Python, C#, and javascript.
I am a team player, outgoing, willing to go the extra mile, and can handle a busy work flow."
