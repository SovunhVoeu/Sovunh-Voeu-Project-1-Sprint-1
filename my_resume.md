**Note:**  Because you are a recent graduate with limited professional experience, focus heavily on your academic projects and skills that align with the job description.  Highlight your proficiency in C#, .NET, and relevant technologies.  Since the job description specifies 3-5 years of experience in an Agile environment, you may need to address this gap in your cover letter.

The cover letter will be crucial in explaining this.
